# Personal Website

This repository hosts the Python script that generates my personal [homepage](https://jens-beisswenger.github.io/).

#Template
The website's design and structure are inspired by [Michael Niemeyer's](https://m-niemeyer.github.io/) personal site. For setup instructions, please refer to his [GitHub](https://github.com/m-niemeyer/m-niemeyer.github.io).
